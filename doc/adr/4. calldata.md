# ADR-004: Calldata Encoding Standard

## Status

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-10-28

## Context

GenVM needs standardized encoding of "calldata" so that any language can read and write it. Calldata is a set of arguments (and method name) that a message carries. Any language should be able to parse it and produce it to call other contracts' `public view` methods or send messages to them.

Code handling is managed by the GenVM host, and message data (value, is_init, etc.) is outside this context.

Key requirements include:
1. Absolute byte-perfect consistency: hash after _serialize âˆ˜ deserialize_ must be identical
2. Compact size to minimize gas costs
3. Support for `bigint` types
4. Support for `Address` types

## Decision

Implement a [custom calldata format](https://sdk.genlayer.com/main/spec/abi/calldata.html) designed specifically for GenVM's requirements.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Solves all identified requirements (consistency, compactness, bigint support, Address support)
- Optimized for GenVM's specific use cases
- Deterministic serialization/deserialization
- Gas-efficient encoding

### Negative

- Not a well-known format, reducing ecosystem familiarity
- No existing tooling available for the format
- Parsing into `uint64` while ensuring it fits may be complex to implement correctly

### Neutral

- Custom format allows for future extensions specific to GenVM needs
- Can be documented and tooling can be developed over time

## Alternatives Considered

1. **JSON**: Standard, widely supported format
   - Rejected due to size inefficiency and lack of native bigint support
   - Not deterministic for floating-point numbers

2. **Protocol Buffers**: Efficient binary serialization
   - Rejected due to complexity and schema versioning issues
   - Not optimized for blockchain gas costs

3. **MessagePack**: Compact binary format
   - Rejected due to lack of native Address type support
   - Not deterministic for all data types

4. **CBOR**: Concise binary object representation
   - Rejected due to similar issues as MessagePack

## Implementation Notes

The custom format must ensure:
- Deterministic byte ordering
- Efficient encoding of common types (integers, strings, addresses)
- Clear specification for bigint representation
- Proper handling of Address types with validation
- Consistent parsing behavior across all supported languages
