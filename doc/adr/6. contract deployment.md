# ADR-006: Contract Deployment via Code

## Status

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-11-10

## Context

GenVM needs to support contract factories - the ability for contracts to deploy other contracts programmatically. This is a common pattern in blockchain systems where contracts create and manage other contracts.

Two main approaches were considered for implementing this functionality, each with different trade-offs in terms of API design and implementation complexity.

## Decision

Implement a custom host function: `gl.deploy_contract(code, args=[], kwargs={}, gas=gas)`

This provides a high-level, user-friendly API for contract deployment directly integrated into the GenVM host functions.

## Consequences

### Positive

- More user-friendly abstraction compared to low-level approaches
- Clean, intuitive API that's easy to use and understand
- No need for users to manually handle calldata encoding
- Direct integration with GenVM's execution model

### Negative

- Requires implementing a new host function
- Additional complexity in the host function implementation
- Potential for API changes as requirements evolve

### Neutral

- Consistent with other GenVM host function patterns
- Provides foundation for future deployment-related features

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Consensus-Documented Approach**: Expose deployment as a contract call to a special address
   ```python
   # Example implementation
   @gl.contract_interface
   class ContractDeployer:
       class Write:
           def deploy(code: bytes, calldata: bytes) -> None: ...

   contract_deployer = ContractDeployer(Address(b'\x00' * 20))
   contract_deployer.emit().deploy(code, gl.calldata.encode({"args": [], "kwargs": {}}))
   ```

   **Rejected because:**
   - Host needs to intercept calls for consensus-friendly packing
   - Requires host to perform calldata decoding and interception
   - Having `calldata.encode` on user side is inconvenient
   - More complex for developers to use correctly

2. **Direct Transaction Approach**: Use blockchain's native deployment transactions
   - Rejected due to lack of programmatic control from within contracts
   - Doesn't support the factory pattern effectively

## Implementation Notes

The custom function implementation requires:
- Integration with the existing host function system
- Proper gas accounting for deployment operations
- Calldata encoding/decoding for constructor arguments
- Error handling for deployment failures
- Support for both positional and named arguments as defined in the ABI specification
