# ADR-001: Sandboxing for Non-Deterministic Operations

## Status

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-09-01

## Context

GenVM needs to be able to execute non-deterministic blocks while containing non-determinism within them. GenVM runs WebAssembly and must isolate changes made by non-deterministic mode from deterministic context.

The main challenge is that allocations happen in "global" memory, which makes it impossible to ban writing to global memory without breaking the execution model.

## Decision

Spawn a new WASM VM instance for non-deterministic mode execution.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Complete safety and isolation between deterministic and non-deterministic contexts
- Guarantees that non-deterministic operations cannot affect deterministic state
- Clear separation of concerns

### Negative

- User unfriendliness: data passed to non-deterministic VM must be serialized and deserialized
- Gas cost: serialization and deserialization operations consume gas
- Performance overhead from VM instantiation

### Neutral

- Maintains strict determinism guarantees for blockchain consensus
- Clear boundary between execution modes

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Function Environment Approach**: Similar to ECMAScript or Lisp function environments
   - Rejected because it's nearly impossible to implement since we don't control global memory allocation in WASM
   - Would require significant modifications to the WASM runtime

2. **Memory Mapping**: Isolate memory regions for different execution modes
   - Rejected due to complexity and potential for memory leaks between modes

## Implementation Notes

The implementation requires careful management of data serialization between VM instances. The serialization format must be deterministic and gas-efficient. Special attention is needed for handling complex data structures that may contain references or circular dependencies.
