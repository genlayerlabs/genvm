# ADR-008: Persistent Storage System Design

## Status

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-12-01

## Context

GenVM needs to provide contracts with persistent storage capabilities. Storage can be language-dependent since only the contract needs to read its own data.

Key challenges include:
1. Traditional data structures are unsuitable for blockchain storage:
   - Allocated addresses are not persistent across executions
   - Allocation requires knowledge of all allocated addresses (expensive at startup)
   - Disallows reference types (multiple references to the same storage location)
   - Serialization works poorly and rewrites entire storage (e.g., during hash table rehashing)

2. Memory management complexities:
   - No purpose in freeing memory since data is persistently stored on blockchain
   - Garbage collection would be extremely expensive for pruned nodes

## Decision

Implement a three-tier storage system:

### Low-Level Storage
- Linear memory slots with `read` and `write` operations
- Uninitialized memory returns zeros
- Basic building block for higher-level abstractions

### Mid-Level Storage
- Host optimizes hot reads/writes for performance
- Caching and batching mechanisms
- Storage delta management

### High-Level Storage
- Custom encoding mapping storage to language constructs:
  1. **Constant-size types**: Stored in-place sequentially
  2. **Variable-size types**: Data stored at `hash_combine(current_slot_addr, offset_in_slot)` with size > 0

### Language-Specific Layer (Python)
- Statically typed storage using type annotations
- Generated view classes for type-safe access
- Structured data organization

## Consequences

### Positive

- Storage efficiency through optimized layout and encoding
- Clear separation of concerns between storage layers
- Language-agnostic low-level interface
- Type safety at the language level

### Negative

- Python must encode/decode structures for every read/write operation
- Requires static typing for storage operations in Python
- "Hidden" complexity may lead to unexpected behaviors
- Cannot use built-in `list` and `dict` types directly with storage
- Performance overhead from encoding/decoding

### Neutral

- Provides foundation for future storage optimizations
- Enables language-specific storage abstractions
- Maintains compatibility with blockchain consensus requirements

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Direct Object Serialization**: Using pickle or similar for entire objects
   - Rejected due to head-recursive serialization causing full storage rewrites
   - Demonstrated poor delta efficiency in testing

2. **Memory-Mapped Storage**: Direct memory mapping to blockchain state
   - Rejected due to address persistence issues and complexity
   - Would require complex memory management

3. **Built-in Collection Support**: Native support for Python lists/dicts
   - Rejected due to implementation complexity and performance concerns
   - Would require deep integration with language runtimes

## Implementation Notes

The storage system requires:
- Efficient hash_combine function for slot addressing
- Optimized serialization formats for common data types
- Type annotation processing for Python storage classes
- Delta tracking for efficient state updates
- Hot storage caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data

Special considerations for Python implementation:
- Type annotations must be processable at runtime
- Generated view classes should provide intuitive APIs
- Error handling for type mismatches and invalid operations
