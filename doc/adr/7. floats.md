# ADR-007: Floating-Point Number Handling

## Status

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-11-20

## Context

Floating-point numbers are [partially non-deterministic](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/main/Nondeterminism.md) in WebAssembly, creating challenges for blockchain consensus. The issues include:

1. NaN bit patterns can vary between implementations
2. NaN sign bits are non-deterministic
3. SIMD operations may flush subnormals to zero
4. Approximation operations may vary between platforms

However, generic programs often assume floating-point support:
- Python: literal parsing (`0.5`), file timestamps, character/byte ratios, datetime module
- Many languages use floats for standard library operations

The challenge is that contracts operate in both deterministic and non-deterministic modes, so float instructions cannot be banned at compile time.

## Decision

Implement a three-part solution:

1. **Runtime Float Banning**: Replace float operations with `unreachable` instructions in deterministic VM codegen
   - Exception: bitcast from integers, constant loading, and parameter passing
2. **Software Float Library**: Provide deterministic software-based floating-point operations
3. **Binary Patching**: Patch binaries to replace hardware float operations with software implementations (e.g., `f64.add` â†’ `call softfloat.f64_add`)

## Consequences

### Positive

- Most floating-point operations work out of the box, including parsing and printing
- Maintains determinism in consensus-critical operations
- Supports languages that require floating-point for standard operations
- Preserves compatibility with existing codebases

### Negative

- If binary is patched, non-deterministic mode also uses slow software implementation
- May require maintaining two nearly identical WASM files for optimal performance
- Performance overhead for floating-point operations in deterministic mode

### Neutral

- Clear distinction between deterministic and non-deterministic execution modes
- Provides foundation for future optimizations

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Complete Float Ban**: Prohibit all floating-point operations
   - Rejected due to breaking compatibility with many standard libraries
   - Would require extensive modifications to language runtimes

2. **Hardware Floats with Normalization**: Use hardware floats but normalize results
   - Rejected due to complexity and potential for missed edge cases
   - Risk of subtle non-determinism

3. **Compile-Time Detection**: Static analysis to detect float usage
   - Rejected because deterministic/non-deterministic modes are runtime decisions
   - Cannot be determined at compile time

## Implementation Notes

The software float library must provide:
- IEEE 754 compliant operations
- Deterministic behavior across all platforms
- Efficient implementations for common operations
- Integration with existing language runtimes

Binary patching requires:
- Comprehensive coverage of all floating-point instructions
- Efficient patching mechanisms
- Careful handling of mixed integer/float operations
