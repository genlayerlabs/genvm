# ADR-002: Code Loading Process for Contracts

## Status

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-10-01

## Context

GenVM needs to be able to run both Python and WASM contracts. Some languages require additional files or code to be executed. For instance, Python requires an interpreter, and C can have dynamically linked libraries.

The challenge is that WASM (or compiled Python) contracts can't have comments with dependency descriptions, making it difficult to specify what additional resources are needed.

## Decision

Introduce a concept of **runners** and define three contract types:

1. **Runners**: Identified by `<human-readable-id>:<hash>` format, packaged as `.zip` files containing:
   - `runner.json` conforming to the [schema](../../runner-schema.json)
   - `version` file
   - Other arbitrary files needed for execution

2. **Contract Types**:
   - **WASM file**: Linked and run as-is without additional steps
   - **ZIP file**: Processed as a runner `.zip` package
   - **Text file**: Starting with comment (`#`, `//`, `--`), where the comment is treated as `runner.json`

## Consequences

### Positive

- Allows for loading libraries and additional files required by contracts
- Enables future functionality like storing libraries on blockchain with `onchain:<address>` runners
- Supports complex execution environments (Python interpreter, C libraries)
- Flexible format supporting multiple languages and their requirements

### Negative

- ZIP archives can only be made deterministic by using fake timestamps, no metadata, no compression, and consistent file ordering
- Solution is somewhat over-engineered for simple use cases
- Adds complexity to the contract loading process

### Neutral

- Provides a standard way to package and distribute contract dependencies
- Enables reproducible builds and deployments

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Embedded Dependencies**: Embedding all dependencies directly in WASM
   - Rejected due to size limitations and complexity of cross-compilation

2. **External Registry**: Separate dependency registry system
   - Rejected due to additional infrastructure requirements and complexity

3. **Inline Metadata**: Using special WASM sections for metadata
   - Rejected because not all target languages support custom WASM sections

## Implementation Notes

The runner system actions can perform various operations, with the main ones being:
- Linking WASM files
- Mapping files to VFS (for libraries)
- Setting up execution environments

Special care must be taken to ensure ZIP file determinism through controlled timestamps, metadata, compression settings, and file ordering.
