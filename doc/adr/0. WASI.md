# ADR-000: WASI Implementation for GenVM

## Status

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-08-10

## Context

GenVM needs to expose its API to different languages and verify that these languages can run in a sandboxed environment. WASM has two main "versions": browser and WASI. The "browser" version expects something relatively unknown to be there: either auto-generated callbacks or `window` access, while WASI has a standard interface.

The challenge is that WASI has several "preview" versions, and we need to choose which one to implement.

## Decision

Implement WASI Preview 1 (wasip1) with deterministic API modifications.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Any language that supports wasip1 target will work without major issues
- Supports VFS for adding multiple files, for instance to load Python modules
- Explicitly bans random/time operations, maintaining determinism
- Provides a deterministic execution environment

### Negative

- WASI Preview 2 (wasip2) is on the horizon, but it is not stabilized yet
- Will be completely incompatible with wasip1, requiring future migration
- Limited to wasip1 capabilities and constraints

### Neutral

- Standard WASI interface provides predictable behavior across languages

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Browser WASM**: Rejected due to unclear requirements and lack of standard interface
2. **WASI Preview 2**: Rejected due to instability and lack of standardization
3. **Custom API**: Rejected due to complexity and lack of ecosystem support

## Implementation Notes

The implementation focuses on maintaining determinism while providing the standard WASI interface. Special attention is paid to filtering out non-deterministic operations like random number generation and time access.
