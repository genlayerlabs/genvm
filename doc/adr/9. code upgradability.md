# ADR-009: Contract Code Upgradability

## Status

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2025-05-10

## Context

Smart contracts need the ability to be upgraded to fix bugs, add features, or adapt to changing requirements. However, upgradability must be balanced with security, immutability guarantees, and user trust. The challenge is providing a flexible upgrade mechanism while preventing unauthorized modifications and maintaining eval-safety.

Traditional blockchain upgrade patterns like proxy contracts have limitations and complexity. GenVM needs a native solution that integrates with its storage system and provides clear upgrade controls.

## Decision

Implement a native upgradability system using a standardized `RootSlot` storage structure that both the node and GenVM executor understand:

```python
# Simplified representation
class RootSlot:
    contract_indirection: Indirection[gl.Contract]
    code: bytes
    locked_slots: list[u256]
    upgraders: list[Address]
```

### Execution Flow

**Deployment:**
- Node writes code to the `code` field
- Contract may populate metadata fields during initialization
- By default, all fields are empty (everything allowed)

**Write Transactions:**
- GenVM reads `upgraders` list from storage
- If sender is not in `upgraders`, GenVM forbids writing to `locked_slots`
- GenVM reads and executes the current `code`
- Default stdlib locks metadata slots (root slot, code, locked_slots, upgraders) making contracts non-upgradable by default

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Flexible Upgrade Control**: Supports multiple upgrade patterns (frozen, upgradable, time-locked)
- **Eval-Safety**: Even if eval tries to manipulate storage, restrictions prevent unauthorized changes
- **Transparency**: Users can determine upgrade status by reading contract storage
- **Future-Extensible**: RootSlot can be extended without breaking changes
- **Merkle-Proofed**: Code is part of the storage tree, enabling proofs
- **Native Integration**: Works seamlessly with GenVM's storage system

### Negative

- **Complexity**: Adds storage overhead and execution complexity
- **Storage Layout Restrictions**: Similar constraints to Solidity for layout modifications
- **Performance Impact**: Additional storage reads for upgrade checks

### Neutral

- **Developer Choice**: Contracts can opt into or out of upgradability
- **Compatible with External Systems**: Can work with timelocks/multisigs implemented in other contracts

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Separate Code Storage**: Save code outside the storage system

   **Rejected because:**
   - Node has full control but lacks eval-safety
   - Requires separate methods for upgrades and code retrieval
   - Code is not merkle-proofed
   - Complicates the API with additional host methods

2. **Frozen Forever Code**: Immutable contracts only

   **Rejected because:**
   - Would be problematic for implementing delegatecall-like functionality
   - Lacks flexibility for legitimate upgrade needs
   - Doesn't support concurrent message queues with distinct read/write methods

3. **Proxy Pattern**: Traditional proxy-based upgrades

   **Rejected because:**
   - Is troublesome in `async` GenLayer

## Implementation Notes

The system supports multiple upgrade patterns:

- **Frozen Contracts**: Empty `upgraders` list + locked metadata slots
- **Upgradable Contracts**: Specific addresses in `upgraders` list (can integrate with timelocks/multisigs)
- **Development-to-Production**: Contracts that become non-upgradable after development completion
- **Eval-Safe**: Prevents unauthorized storage manipulation even through eval

The RootSlot is located at a zero-filled SlotID and can be extended in future releases without requiring protocol changes or workarounds.
