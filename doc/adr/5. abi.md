# ADR-005: Application Binary Interface (ABI) Design

## Status

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-11-01

## Context

Contracts need a standardized ABI (Application Binary Interface). Everything is encoded as [calldata](./4.%20calldata.md), but this calldata must have a defined structure. Similar to how POSIX defines `_start` as a program's entry point, GenVM needs standardized contract interfaces.

Key considerations include:
- Getting contract schema as part of the ABI
- Argument passing strategies (positional vs named vs combined)
- Balance between gas efficiency and developer experience

## Decision

Implement a combined approach with clear separation between positional and named arguments, plus a standardized schema system:

### Method Calls
```ts
{
    "method": string,
    "args": Array<CalldataEncodable> | absent,
    "kwargs": Dict<CalldataEncodable> | absent
}
```

### Constructor Calls
```ts
{
    "args": Array<CalldataEncodable> | absent,
    "kwargs": Dict<CalldataEncodable> | absent
}
```

### Schema Retrieval
Special method call with `"method": "#get-schema"` returning JSON-schema-like structure.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Languages without keyword arguments can accept dictionaries as parameters
- Developers don't need to think about optimal names for positional arguments
- Schema can be regenerated via simple contract call - completely pure operation
- Language-independent schema format
- Schema can be obtained before deployment/constructor execution
- Clear separation between positional and named arguments reduces complexity

### Negative

- GenVM must be executed to obtain ABI (cannot be statically determined)
- Requires runtime schema generation capability
- Additional complexity in method call handling

### Neutral

- Provides flexibility for different language paradigms
- Enables both gas-efficient (positional) and developer-friendly (named) approaches

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Positional Arguments Only**: Used by most languages (C, C++, Go, Rust, Java, etc.)
   - Rejected due to reduced readability and increased error potential

2. **Named Arguments Only**: Used by Swift by default
   - Rejected due to gas inefficiency and uncommon usage patterns

3. **Python-style Combined**: Full flexibility like Python's argument system
   - Rejected due to excessive complexity and potential for ambiguous calls

## Implementation Notes

The schema system uses a comprehensive type system including:
- Primitive types: `"bool"`, `"null"`, `"int"`, `"string"`, `"bytes"`, `"address"`
- Terminals: `"array"`, `"dict"`, `"any"`
- Unions: `{ "$or": [<type>*] }`
- Arrays: `[<type>*, { "$rep": <type> }?]`
- References: `{ "$ref": "/path" }`

The `#get-schema` method runs in pure mode without storage write access, ensuring deterministic schema generation.
