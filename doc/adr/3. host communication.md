# ADR-003: Host Communication Protocol

## Status

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-10-10

## Context

GenVM cannot run without blockchain integration and needs to get data from the host node. The host possesses critical information including:

1. State data (storage, balances, etc.)
2. Message data (calldata, msg.value, etc.)
3. Storage deltas that must be accumulated
4. Leadership status and leader's results

Key challenges include performance requirements and the need for hot read/write optimizations.

## Decision

Use a custom trivial Unix domain socket stream protocol for synchronous data exchange between GenVM and the host.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Ease of development and implementation
- Sufficient performance for current requirements
- Simple debugging and monitoring
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Negative

- [Shared memory may be faster](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2101671/unix-domain-sockets-vs-shared-memory-mapped-file) for high-frequency operations
- Having storage on GenVM side would yield better hot storage optimizations
- Potential bottleneck for high-throughput scenarios

### Neutral

- Protocol can be evolved or replaced as performance requirements change
- Maintains clear separation between GenVM and host responsibilities

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Shared Memory**: Direct memory sharing between processes
   - Rejected due to complexity and platform-specific implementation requirements
   - Would require complex synchronization mechanisms

2. **Local Storage in GenVM**: Moving storage management to GenVM side
   - Rejected due to architectural concerns and consensus requirements
   - Would complicate the separation of concerns

3. **HTTP/REST API**: Standard web protocols
   - Rejected due to unnecessary overhead for local communication

## Implementation Notes

The protocol should be designed to be simple yet extensible. Consider implementing batching for multiple operations to reduce round-trip overhead. Monitor performance metrics to identify when migration to shared memory might be necessary.
