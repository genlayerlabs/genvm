# WASI

- [x] has ADR (1 semi alternative)

## Initial problem statement

GenVM needs to expose itâ€™s API to different languages and to verify that these languages can run in a sandboxed environment

## Context

WASM has two "versions": browser and wasi. "Browser" version expects something relatively unknown to be there: either auto generated callbacks or `window` access, while wasi has a standard interface

## Sub problems
1. wasi has few "preview" versions

## Solution
Implement wasip1 with deterministic API

## Pros
1. Any language that supports wasip1 tartget is going to work without major issues
2. This supports vfs for adding multiple files, for instance to load python modules
3. It explicitly bans random/time/...
4. It is determinisitc

## Cons
1. wasip2 is on the horizon, however it is not stabilized yet. It will be completely incompatible with wasip1
