# ABI

- [ ] has ADR

## Initial problem statement
Contracts should have some *abi*. Everything is encoded as [calldata](./4.%20calldata.md), but this calldata must have some structure

## Context
For instance, default abi for posix states that `_start` is an entrypoint of the program

## Sub problems
Getting contract schema is part of the *abi*

### Arguments
There are three approaches for passing arguments:
1. Positional<br >
    used in most languages (C, C++, go, Rust, Java, Zig, Haskell, ecmascript, ...)
2. Named<br>
    No popular language uses solely this approach, but it is the default for Swift (there is a special syntax to make parameter positional, being underscore as an external parameter name `_ paramName: ParamType`)
3. Combined<br>
    Lots of languages introduced them (Python, Ruby, Kotlin, C#, PHP, Dart)<br>
    Main cons of this approach is complexity, all of the following is valid in python:
    ```py
    def foo(x, y): ...
    foo(1, 2)
    foo(1, y=2)
    foo(y=2, x=1)
    ```

### Constructors

### Schema

## Solution

### Calls

Named arguments are more verbose and less bug prone than positional, but consume more gas and aren't the default in a lot of languages. To address problem of introduced complexity GenVM will completely separate named and positional arguments, as ruby does.

Example:
```py
# valid
def foo(x, y, *, z): ...

# invalid
def foo(x, y, z): ...
```

Method calls have a calldata of form
```ts
{
    "method": string,
    "args": Array<CalldataEncodable> | absent,
    "kwargs": Dict<CalldataEncodable> | absent
}
```

Constructor calls have a calldata of form
```ts
{
    "args": Array<CalldataEncodable> | absent,
    "kwargs": Dict<CalldataEncodable> | absent
}
```
Note that constructor should be private

### Schema

Getting schema has a calldata of form
```ts
{
    "method": "__get_schema__"
}
```
This method is ran in a "pure" mode: no storage access, etc; and returns a (calldata encoded) `string` which is a json-schema-like with the following structure

Types:
1. Primitive types: `"bool"`, `"null"`, `"int"`, `"string"`, `"bytes"`, `"address"`
2. Terminals: `"array"`, `"dict"`, `"any"`
3. Unions `{ "$or": [<type>*] }`
4. Arrays `[<type>*, { "$rep": <type> }?]`

There is a special object: `{ "$ref": "/path" }` which "includes" json element at that path one-to-one

```ts
type Primitive = "bool" | "null" | "int" | "string" | "bytes" | "address" ;;
type Term = "array" | "dict" | "any" ;;
type Union = { "$or": Array<Type> } ;;
type Arr = [Type*, { "$rep": Type }?] ;;

type ObjectProp = {
    optional?: bool, // false
    type: Type,
} ;;

type Object = { [key: string]: ObjectProp } ;;

type Dict = { "$dict": Type } ;;

type Annotated = { "$comment": string, type: Type } ;;

type Type = Primitive | Term | Union | Arr | Dict | Annotated ;;

const Method = {
    "args": [{ "$rep": ["string", Type] }],
    "kwargs": Object,
    "readonly": "bool",
    "ret": Type,
}

const Schema = {
    "defs": "any",
    "ctor": Method,
    "methods": { "$dict": Method },
}
```
Note, `$$` in the beginning will be interpreted as a single `$`


## Pros
1. Languages that don't have keyword arguments but want to provide a way to use them, can just accept a dictionary as the last parameter
2. Developer doesn't need to think about the best name for positional arguments
3. If schema is lost it can be regenerated via a simple call to the contract, or running it locally. As it is completely pure, nothing except for the code file and genvm is needed
4. Schema is language independent
5. Schema can be gotten before deployment/calling a constructor

## Cons
1. GenVM needs to be ran to get ABI
