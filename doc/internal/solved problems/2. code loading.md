# Process of loading code for a contract

- [ ] has ADR (no alternatives)

## Initial problem statement
GenVM needs to be able to run both python and wasm contracts

## Context
Some languages require more files or code to be ran. For instance Python requires an interpreter, C can have a dynamically linked library

## Sub problems
1. Wasm (or compiled python) contract can't have a comment with the description of dependencies

## Solution

### Runners
Introduce a concept of a **runner** which is identified by `<human-readable-id>:<hash>` and is a `.zip` file. This file must contain `runner.json` conforming to [schema](../../runner-schema.json) and other arbitrary files. This file is processed as follows:
- `pre_actions` are applied
- `depends` (runners) are loaded and applied using same schema, but the same dependency won't be loaded twice
- `actions` are applied

Actions can do various things, main of which are linking wasm files and mapping files to vfs (libraries)

### Contracts definition
Then contract is one of the following:
1. wasm file, then it is linked and ran as-is, without any additional steps
2. zip file, then it is processed as a [runner `.zip`](#runners)
3. text file starting with a comment (as of now, `#`, `//`, `--` are supported), then it's comment is treated as `runner.json` (from runner `.zip`)

## Pros
- It allows for loading libraries and files
- It will be possible to store a library on a blockchain and introduce a new runner such as `onchain:<address>`

## Cons
- zip archieves can be made determinisitic only by using fake timestamps, no metadata, no compression and same file order
- this solution is a bit overengineered
