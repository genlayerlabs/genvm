# Contract deployment via code

## Initial problem statement
We need to support contract factories

## Solutions

### Exposing consensus documented approach
As per consensus docs deployment is a transaction to special address

Then in GenLayer py sdk it can look like a contract call, i.e.

```py
# in stdlib
@gl.contract_interface
class ContractDeployer:
    class Write:
        def deploy(code: bytes, calldata: bytes) -> None: ...

contract_deployer = ContractDeployer(Address(b'\x00' * 20))

# in user contract
gl.contract_deployer.emit(gas=gas).deploy(code, gl.calldata.encode({ "args": [], "kwargs": {} }))
```

#### Implications
- host needs to intercept this call to pack code and calldata in consensus-friendly way

#### Pros
- low-level API
#### Cons
- host needs to do calldata decoding and interception
- having `calldata.encode` on user side in inconvenient

### Having custom function

```py
# in user contract
gl.deploy_contract(code, args=[], kwargs={}, gas=gas)
```

#### Implications
- new host function

#### Pros
- more user friendly abstraction
#### Cons
