# Sandboxing

- [x] has ADR (1 alternative)

## Initial problem statement
GenVM needs to be able to execute nondeterministic blocks and contain nondeterminism within them

## Context
GenVM runs webassembly and must isolate changes made by non deterministic mode from deterministic context

## Sub problems
Allocations happen in "global" memory, which makes it impossible to ban writing to global memory

## Solution
Spawning new wasm vm for nondeterministic mode

## Pros
- Safety

## Cons
- User unfriendliness: data passed to non-determinisitc vm must be serialized and deserialized
- Gas cost: serialization and deserialization costs gas
