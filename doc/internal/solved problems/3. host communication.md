# Communication with a _Host_ (node)

- [ ] has ADR (? node should have it)

## Initial problem statement
GenVM can't run without blockchain and needs to get some data from it

## Context
1. _Host_ posesses the state: contracts code and storage
2. _Host_ has message data: `calldata`, `msg.value`, ...
3. _Host_ must accumulate deltas
4. _Host_ knows if it is the leader and has leader's result or not

## Sub problems
1. Performance
2. Hot read/write optimizations

## Solution
Use custom trivial unix domain socket stream protocol for synchonyous data exchange

## Pros
1. Ease of development
2. Sufficient performance

## Cons
1. [Shared memory may be faster](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2101671/unix-domain-sockets-vs-shared-memory-mapped-file)
2. Having storage on GenVM side would yield better hot storage optimziations
