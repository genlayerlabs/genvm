GenVM is the execution environment for Intelligent Contracts in the GenLayer protocol. It serves as the backbone for processing and managing contract operations within the GenLayer ecosystem.

GenVM's only purpose is to execute Intelligent Contracts, which can have non-deterministic code while maintaining blockchain security and consistency.

## About

It is a monorepo for GenVM, which consists of the following sub-projects:

- [executor](./executor/) core GenVM itself: modified [`wasmtime`](https://wasmtime.dev) which exposes genvm-sdk-wasi implementation and does all the sandboxing work
- [sdk-rust](./sdk-rust/): rust bindings for genvm-sdk-wasi, this library is autogenerated from [witx](./executor/src/wasi/witx/genlayer_sdk.witx)
- [runners](./runners/): various "runners" available for contracts to use
    - software floating point implementation
    - python interpreter with built-in `sdk-rust`
    - python standard library from genlayer
    - ...

##  GenVM for users

For "getting started" documentation please refer to [GenLayer documentation](https://docs.genlayer.com/build-with-genlayer/intelligent-contracts)



## Building from source

Prelude:
- `./tools/ya-build/ya-build config`<br />
  This command scraps and configures all targets (similar to CMake)
- `ninja` is an alternative to `make`, it runs build commands
- Output is located at `build/out` as a "root" (`bin`, `lib`, `share`)

Required tools:
- git
- ruby (3.\*, otherwise it will be installed from a script)
- [...](./build-scripts/src/ubuntu.sh) can be installed via scripts (see below)

### Simple
1. `cd $PROJECT_DIR`
2. `git submodule update --init --recursive --depth 1`
3. `./build-scripts/install/install-deps.rb --os --rust --genvm`
4. `source env.sh`
5. `git third-party update --all`
7. `ya-build config` (for release build pass `--preload .ci/release-conf.rb`)
8. `ninja -C build genvm/executor/all`
9. Get `genvm-runners.zip` from [github](https://github.com/yeagerai/genvm)
10. merge `build/out` and `genvm-runners.zip`

### Full

It will also require `docker` and `docker-buildx`

1. `cd $PROJECT_DIR`
2. `git submodule update --init --recursive --depth 1`
3. `./build-scripts/install/install-deps.rb --os --rust --genvm --runners`
4. `source env.sh`
5. `ya-build config` (for release build pass `--preload .ci/release-conf.rb`)
6. `ninja -C build tags/all`
7. full genvm (including runners) is located at `build/out`
